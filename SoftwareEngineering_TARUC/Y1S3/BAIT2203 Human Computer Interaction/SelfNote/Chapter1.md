# Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

## What is HCI

* In the past, Man-Machine Interaction (MMI)
* Human + Computer + Interaction
* Usability is the main concept in HCI

## The Goals of HCI

* Increase individual & organizational productivity
* Reduce costs associated with the development of user interfaces

## User Interface (UI)

* UI is the part of the system that users can interact with.
* eg. SEE, HEAR, TOUCH
* In a standard PC, UI may consists of
  * SCREEN
  * KEYBOARD
  * MOUSE
  * SPEAKER

## Human

* The user (human) is the one whom computer systems are designed to assist. So, we need to know user (human) capabilities and limitations.

## Interaction

* Keywords:
  * User Interface (UI)
  * Usability
  * User Experience (UX)

## Usability

Definition: The **effectiveness**, **efficiency** and **satisfaction** with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments. (ISO 9241-11:2018)

* International Standard Organisation (ISO 9241-11:2018)
  * Effectiveness
  * Efficiency
  * Satisfaction
* Benefits of systems with GOOD USABILITY
  * **To USERS**
  * Increased productivity
  * Reduce learning time
  * Reduce errors
  * **TO DEVELOPERS**
  * Minimize the cost of customer support
  * Reduce time needed for training
  * Good reputation

## Effectiveness

Effectiveness is the **completeness** and **accuracy** with which users achieve **specified goals**

* Determined by looking at whether the user's goals were met successfully and whether all works are correct.
* Measurement of how well the system performs (desired output = actual output).
* “Can users use the system to do the work they need to do?”

## Efficiency

Efficiency is the **resources** used in relation to the **results achived**. (Typical resources include time, human effot, costs and materials)

* Efficiency concerned primarily with how **quickly** a task can be completed,while effectiveness considers how well the work is done.
* “Can experience users be productive using the system?”

## Satisfaction

Satisfaction is the user's physical, cognitive and emotional responses that result from the use of a system, product or service meet the user's needs and expectations.

* The comfort and acceptability of the work system to its users and other people affected by its usages.
* "How pleasant is it to use the design?"

## User Experience (UX)

Person's perceptions and responses resulting from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service.

* Keywords:
  * Enjoyable
  * Fun
  * Entertaining
  * Helpful
  * Informative
  * etc...
