### Segmentation vs Multiplexing

**Segmentation** - Divides data into smaller, more manageable pieces.
**Mulitplexing** - Many different conversations can be interleaved on the network, giving user a part of the bandwidth.

Benefits 1 - By dividing the data into smaller pieces, many different conversations can be interleave on the network.
Benefits 2 - Increase the reliability of the network communications.

### Protocol vs Protocol Suite

**Protocol** - A set of rules or conventions that is used to govern a particular aspect of how a device communicate on the network.
**Protocol Suite** - A group of inter-related protocols that are neccessary to perform a communication function.

### Benefits of Layered Model

1. Foster competition because devices from different vendors can work together.
2. Prevents technological capabilites changes in a layer from affecting other layers above and below.
3. Provides a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities.

### Protocol Model(TCP/IP) vs Reference Model(OSI)

**Protocol model** provides a model that closely matches the structure of a particular protocol suite. The related protocols typically represents all the functionality require to interface the human network and the data network, whereas a **reference model** provides a common reference for maintaining consistency within all types of network protocols and services. Generally, reference model is used as a guidance tool. It is not intended to be an actual implementation, just aid to understanding of different functions and process involved such as OSI Model. On the other hand, protocol model is an actual implementation such as TCP/IP Model.

### Reference Model(OSI)

**Application Layer (Data)**
**Presentation Layer (Data)**
**Session Layer (Data)**
**Transport Layer (Segments/Datagram)**
**Network Layer (Packets)**
**Data Link Layer (Frames)**
**Physical Layer (Bits)**

* Functions of each layer

* PDU of each layer

* Transport Layer PDU(TCP - Segment), PDU(UDP - Datagram)

### Interaction of Protocols

* HTTP, TCP, IP, Protocols

## Chapter 3

### Throughput vs Bandwidth

**Throughput** is an actual measure of how much data can be successfully transferred from source to destination whereas **Bandwidth** is just a theoritical measure of how much data can be transferred from source to destination. Throughput measures speed while bandwidth is indirectly related to speed.

### What is Bandwidth?

* Provided by ISP

* Why bandwidth is low?

* Because of ISP Coverage

### Types of Fiber Media

Single Mode vs Multimode

## Chapter 4

### Contention-based Access vs Controlled Access

#### Contention-based Access

* Stations can transmit at anytime.
* Collisions exists.

#### Controlled Access

* Only one station can transmit at a time.
* Devices wishing to transmit must wait for their turn.
* No collisions.
